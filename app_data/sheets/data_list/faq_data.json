Raise the inactivity issue, and Aask the group what can help everyone to share. For example, split into pairs or smaller groups and share findings with the big group afterwards (this is easier than sharing only own experiences). Also, emphasize the importance of respecting each other’s opinions. Praise makes a difference! Remember to praise every time a participant shares. If specific participants are not actively engaged, ask them questions directly. You can use the “catch the ball and answer” strategy: Throw an imaginary ball at any participant and ask them to respond to the question asked. Low participation may also be caused by participants being tired. Do a quick energiser to bring back energy to the group and get people active again.",

Link the question to participants’ personal experience (e.g. “If this happened to you, how would you/your teen feel?”). Make sure you prepare your session well: Simplify and/or translate words that may be difficult to understand. Know your group: If your group loves to engage in specific discussions, frame the discussion in advance (e.g. “I know this discussion will be so exciting. If you don’t get a chance to share now, there will be more opportunities”). Work together as co-facilitators.
