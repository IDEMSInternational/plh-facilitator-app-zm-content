      "introduction": "Good news! Almost every challenge you encounter as a facilitator can be resolved using the facilitation skills you learned during your training. \n\nWhatever the challenge is, be positive and encouraging to make everyone feel welcome, valued and supported as equal members of the group. \n\nRemind participants of the ground rules you created together, whenever needed. As a group, you set the boundaries to make your group work well! \n\nInvite participants to identify their own solutions. You can guide them by asking how a situation makes them feel and by exploring the (possible) consequences of a behaviour or proposed solution. \n\nSpeak from your heart and in your own words (based on your great HHPP knowledge). This creates the safe space that is needed for everyone to work together well.\n\nYou are the expert that is in the best position to solve any challenge that may come!",

If you don‚Äôt get a chance to share now, there will be more opportunities‚Äù). \n\nWork together as co-facilitators. Plan together and help your co-facilitator to keep track of time - if they go over time, signal to them discreetly that it is time to move to the next activity.\n\nüí° **Introducing the session takes too much time**\n\nKnow the goal of your session: What do you want participants to learn? \nRead and understand the facilitator notes at the start of the session. Pick out the key points of the session that will help participants master important new skills.\nWrite out a short summary of the key points that you identified.

Remember, you can have experience with children without having your own children!\n\nEmphasize that participants and facilitators are all equal and have valuable contributions to make (emphasize this from the start during recruitment).\n\nPlan and prepare well for your session so you can positively impact your participants through the programme.

Then ask the group for other thoughts, to divert from the disagreement between the participants. \n\n3.

Simplify the question so everyone understands the question (this can include translating)\n2. Link the question to participants‚Äô personal experience (e.g. ‚ÄúIf this happened to you, how would you/your teen feel?‚Äù). Make sure you prepare your session well: Simplify and/or translate words that may be difficult to understand. Know your group: If your group loves to engage in specific discussions, frame the discussion in advance (e.g. ‚ÄúI know this discussion will be so exciting. If you don‚Äôt get a chance to share now, there will be more opportunities‚Äù). Work together as co-facilitators. Help your co-facilitator to keep track of time - if they go over time, signal to them discreetly that it is time to move to the next activity.",
