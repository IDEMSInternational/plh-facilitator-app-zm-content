Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n❗ **Violence** against children is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,Article 19)\n❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using the child for economical or sexual benefit, for gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the child. (Save the Children definition)\n2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a parent or child discloses abuse. \n📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a parent or child reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the child), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n🔑 It is your responsibility to act regardless of whether you are responding to disclosures of past and/or present abuse. However, you are not responsible for resolving the situation on your own. It is important that you discuss the situation with your supervisor to agree on what steps to take next.\n3️⃣ **Ensure parents know that you are someone who can help.**\n🌷Parents participating in your sessions need to know that they can come to you for help, regardless of when abuse occurred. \n👂You should make sure that they know that they can trust you and that you will listen and support them without judgement or any further harm.","faq_title":"Safeguarding Guidelines"},{"id":"article_1","number":1,"title":"Family Goals & One-on-One Time","introduction":"**GOALS**\n1️⃣ Introduce the programme to the families\n2️⃣ Establish ground rules\n3️⃣ Discuss changes that occur during adolescence\n4️⃣ Share SPECIFIC, POSITIVE, and REALISTIC goals of parents and teens for the programme\n5️⃣ Discuss and practice One-on-One Time together\n\n**CORE PRINCIPLES**\n✅ Goals should be specific, positive, and realistic\n⭐ Short-term goals can lead to long-term achievement in life\n🔑 One-on-One Time with your parent/teen builds trust, communication, and positive relationships\n👂 Use Active Listening skills during One-on-One Time \n🌷 One-on-One Time shows that you value your teen\n\n**MATERIALS**\n📝Attendance register, name tags, temporary adhesive, pens, paper, flipchart, toys, refreshments for the break\n🔑House of Support poster\n\n**PREPARATION**\n1️⃣  Set up the room with chairs in a circle. \n2️⃣ Prepare materials for name tags and refreshments for break\n\n*After your session, you can follow up with your parents over WhatsApp using the message below:*\n","message_1":"😃 Hello and thanks for participating this week!

Ask them! ✅ By asking, you show that you care and want to be involved! \n3️⃣ **LEND A HAND**👋It can sometimes be difficult to remember to ask your spouse if they need help. 💡 Once you start asking, they may realise you want to be more involved and begin asking for your help on their own.   \n4️⃣ **ASK FOR HELP**😒 It can be hard to ask for help. Sometimes we expect our spouses to know we need help even if we don’t ask them. ⭐Once you start asking, they will likely start offering to help more in the future! 💚 Thank your spouse!

celebrating.svg"},{"id":"question_1","number":1,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Participants come late to sessions","introduction":"Ensure that being on time is included in the ground rules. Before closing the session, revisit the ground rules on punctuality. Explore with the group possible consequences for being on time or coming late, to emphasize why coming on time is important. Ask your group if the day and time of the group session still works best or should change. Use the buddy system: Buddies can remind each other of the session start time or even come together. This way, Coming on time becomes a shared responsibility."},{"id":"question_2","number":2,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Participants do not participate actively","introduction":"Remind the group of your ground rule that everyone’s opinion is welcome in the group (or use the opportunity to add a ground rule like this around participation). Explore with your group why it is important that everyone contributes. Keep reminding the group that teens’ input and experiences add value to the group. Raise the inactivity issue, and Aask the group what can help everyone to share. For example, split into pairs or smaller groups and share findings with the big group afterwards (this is easier than sharing only own experiences). Also, emphasize the importance of respecting each other’s opinions. Praise makes a difference! Remember to praise every time a participant shares. If specific participants are not actively engaged, ask them questions directly. You can use the “catch the ball and answer” strategy: Throw an imaginary ball at any participant and ask them to respond to the question asked. Low participation may also be caused by participants being tired. Do a quick energiser to bring back energy to the group and get people active again."},{"id":"question_3","number":3,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"There is a long silence ","introduction":"Try to identify why the silence is happening: It might be that the group do not understand the question - Simplify your question or break down your instructions into smaller steps to ensure that the group can follow well. Participants may be tired, especially if the session has been going on for a while. Do a quick energiser to bring back energy to the group and get people active again. If the silence is caused by people being reluctant to share, try out the tips for the challenge ‘Participants do not participate actively’."},{"id":"question_4","number":4,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Particular participants talk too much","introduction":"Remind the group of your ground rule that everyone’s opinion is welcome in the group (or use the opportunity to add a ground rule like this around participation). Thank the person who wants to contribute and say: “Let's give others a chance to share as well”. If someone generally gives long responses, you can say: “I always appreciate your contributions. Could you please share a shorter response so I can summarize your point before moving on to the next point?”. Then Paraphrase their point, thank them, and say “Now let’s hear what others think. Bibi, I have not heard from you in a while - what do you think?”. You can limit the length of responses as well by saying: “For this question, everyone can share one idea, so others also get a chance to share.” too much"},{"id":"question_5","number":5,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Particular participants volunteer to do activities all the time","introduction":"Explain that you would like to give everyone a chance to try out the activities: “Thank you for volunteering.

For the sake of time we have to move on now. You will get another opportunity to share in the next discussion/session”."},{"id":"question_7","number":7,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Parents do not feel comfortable to talk about certain issues in front of their teen","introduction":"Explore the benefits of spending one-on-one time together. Emphasize that that is how parents and teens build trust and confidence to talk about more challenging topics and deal with difficult situations together. Help parents think about their own past and about what information they would have loved to discuss with their own parents. Explore the realities and risks that teens need to navigate, and ask what role parents should take: “In our society, do these things happen? How much knowledge do our teens have and what risks do they run? How can we help them?” Explore the consequences of parents and teens not talking about difficult topics: “If parents and teens do not talk about these topics, where will teens get this information?”. Answers may include school, friends, social media. Explore how these sources may give inaccurate or incomplete information and what the consequences are."},{"id":"question_8","number":8,"Group":"Attendance and Participation","title":"Participants cannot be reached for follow-up (phone call or home visit)","introduction":"Ask the participant’s buddy to update the participant on the session they missed. Find out from the buddy what a good time is to visit or call (or give a ‘missed call’ when the participant is available so you can call them back). Ask the participant to come early to the next session so you can update them on the previous content. Agree with your coordinator how many follow-up phone calls, messages, or visits you should do before the participant is considered a dropout."},{"id":"question_9","number":9,"Group":"Time management","title":"Activities take more time than anticipated ","introduction":"After (small) group discussions, select only a few participants (not all) to share their experiences - until you have gotten the learning points you are looking for. As soon as participants have shared those answers, summarize the key learnings and move to the next question. If participants struggle to get to the required learning points, do the following: 1) Simplify the question so everyone understands the question (this can include translating),, 2) Link the question to participants’ personal experience (e.g. “If this happened to you, how would you/your teen feel?”). Make sure you prepare your session well: Simplify and/or translate words that may be difficult to understand. Know your group: If your group loves to engage in specific discussions, frame the discussion in advance (e.g. “I know this discussion will be so exciting. If you don’t get a chance to share now, there will be more opportunities”). Work together as co-facilitators. Help your co-facilitator to keep track of time - if they go over time, signal to them discreetly that it is time to move to the next activity."},{"id":"question_10","number":10,"Group":"Time management","title":"Introducing the session takes too much time","introduction":"Know the goal of your session: What do you want participants to learn? Read and understand the facilitator notes at the start of the session. Pick out the key points of the session that will help participants master important new skills. Write out a short summary of the key points that you identified. This can be as short as 3 sentences! Add one sentence to link the current session to the previous session (not all previous sessions)."},{"id":"question_11","number":11,"Group":"Facilitation skills","title":"Participants question my abilities as a facilitator (saying I am too young, inexperienced, or do not have children)","introduction":"You can try to prevent these challenges by putting yourself in the parents’ shoes and speaking of ‘us parents’ from the start of the programme so participants can identify with you. Remember - Yyou can have experience with children without having your own children! Emphasize that participants and facilitators are all equal and have valuable contributions to make (emphasize this from the start during recruitment). Plan and prepare well for your session so you can positively impact your participants through the programme. That will build trust and confidence over time."},{"id":"question_12","number":12,"Group":"Facilitation skills","title":"Participants suggest a solution that is not helpful","introduction":"Follow the next steps: 1. Stay friendly and accept what was shared.\n2. Explore what the consequences are (or would be) of the suggested action. Make sure to explore what impact the solution has on 1) feelings/emotions and 2) the relationship with the teen/parent. This will help the participant to identify the negative outcome of the solution for themselves.\n3. Then, help the participant to come up with an alternative solution, by asking “what else could you try to solve this situation?”.\n4. Finaly, Connect the suggested positive solution to building blocks of the sessions, to emphasize how this solution will work better. "},{"id":"question_13","number":13,"Group":"Facilitation skills","title":"Participants have a disagreement with each other","introduction":"The key is to Make sure to stay neutral and not take sides in the discussion:\n1. Remind participants of the ground rules they agreed on (everyone’s opinion and experience is welcome, it is okay for people to have different views, raise your hand before sharing).\n2. Then ask the group for other thoughts, to divert from the disagreement between the participants.\n3. After the session, Have a one-on-one check-in with both participants to check if they feel they were heard or if they still want to explain themselves more. This can prevent participants from dropping out of the programme."},{"id":"question_14","number":14,"Group":"Facilitation skills","title":"Participants share personal information outside of the group","introduction":"If a participant shared confidential information, lead a group discussion on confidentiality:\n1. Remind of ground rules (e.g. ‘Remember that we have a ground rule that says ‘if someone shares a personal story, we keep it within the group’?\n2. Identify the issue and explore emotions: ‘’It has come to my attention that some information was shared, so I would just like to find out from all of you ‘how would you feel if you trust someone and they share your private information? ’ (sad, betrayed etc.) ‘Do you think the person whose information was shared, felt those emotions?’ (they will probably agree)\n3. Identify possible solutions: (e.g. ‘What do you think is the right thing to do for the person who shared the information?’ (apologize):\n4. Accept the answer: ‘’Thank you very much. So if you shared information of someone who trusted you, please take the time to apologize to that person.\n5. Thank participants for sharing and emphasize also what CAN be shared: ‘Thank you everyone for your contributions, and just remember, you can share all the skills and songs that we learn, but let’s keep personal information in this safe space’’).\n6. End discussion with an energiser to bring back positive energy to the space, before continuing with your session. If the situation persists, have a separate one-on-one conversation with the participants involved."},{"id":"question_15","number":15,"Group":"Facilitation skills","title":"Participants only share positive emotions during check-in","introduction":"During the first group sessions, you are still building a relationship and trust in the group, so people may not share how they really feel (especially if people are not used to sharing their emotions). If you see by session 3 that people only share positive emotions. In the next session I model how negative emotions can be shared by sharing your own challenging emotion. Remember to remind participants that all emotions are normal and welcome in the space.
