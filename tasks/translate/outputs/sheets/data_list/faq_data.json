Explore with the group possible consequences for being on time or coming late, to emphasize why coming on time is important. Ask your group if the day and time of the group session still works best or should change. Use the buddy system: Buddies can remind each other of the session start time or even come together. This way, Coming on time becomes a shared responsibility.",

      "introduction": "Remind the group of your ground rule that everyone’s opinion is welcome in the group (or use the opportunity to add a ground rule like this around participation). Explore with your group why it is important that everyone contributes. Keep reminding the group that teens’ input and experiences add value to the group. Raise the inactivity issue, and Aask the group what can help everyone to share. For example, split into pairs or smaller groups and share findings with the big group afterwards (this is easier than sharing only own experiences). Also, emphasize the importance of respecting each other’s opinions. Praise makes a difference! Remember to praise every time a participant shares. If specific participants are not actively engaged, ask them questions directly. You can use the “catch the ball and answer” strategy: Throw an imaginary ball at any participant and ask them to respond to the question asked. Low participation may also be caused by participants being tired. Do a quick energiser to bring back energy to the group and get people active again.",

Participants may be tired, especially if the session has been going on for a while. Do a quick energiser to bring back energy to the group and get people active again.

Explore the realities and risks that teens need to navigate, and ask what role parents should take: “In our society, do these things happen? How much knowledge do our teens have and what risks do they run? How can we help them?” Explore the consequences of parents and teens not talking about difficult topics: “If parents and teens do not talk about these topics, where will teens get this information?”.

As soon as participants have shared those answers, summarize the key learnings and move to the next question. If participants struggle to get to the required learning points, do the following: 1) Simplify the question so everyone understands the question (this can include translating),, 2) Link the question to participants’ personal experience (e.g. “If this happened to you, how would you/your teen feel?”). Make sure you prepare your session well: Simplify and/or translate words that may be difficult to understand. Know your group: If your group loves to engage in specific discussions, frame the discussion in advance (e.g. “I know this discussion will be so exciting. If you don’t get a chance to share now, there will be more opportunities”). Work together as co-facilitators. Help your co-facilitator to keep track of time - if they go over time, signal to them discreetly that it is time to move to the next activity.",

This will help the participant to identify the negative outcome of the solution for themselves.\n3.

Then ask the group for other thoughts, to divert from the disagreement between the participants.\n3.

Identify the issue and explore emotions: ‘’It has come to my attention that some information was shared, so I would just like to find out from all of you ‘how would you feel if you trust someone and they share your private information? ’ (sad, betrayed etc.) ‘Do you think the person whose information was shared, felt those emotions?’ (they will probably agree)\n3. Identify possible solutions: (e.g. ‘What do you think is the right thing to do for the person who shared the information?’ (apologize):\n4. Accept the answer: ‘’Thank you very much. So if you shared information of someone who trusted you, please take the time to apologize to that person.\n5. Thank participants for sharing and emphasize also what CAN be shared: ‘Thank you everyone for your contributions, and just remember, you can share all the skills and songs that we learn, but let’s keep personal information in this safe space’’).\n6.
